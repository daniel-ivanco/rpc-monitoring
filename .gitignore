#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

/rpc-monitoring/db/*.sqlite3
/rpc-monitoring/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/rpc-monitoring/log/*
/rpc-monitoring/tmp/*
!/rpc-monitoring/log/.keep
!/rpc-monitoring/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/rpc-monitoring/tmp/pids/*
!/rpc-monitoring/tmp/pids/
!/rpc-monitoring/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/rpc-monitoring/storage/*
!/rpc-monitoring/storage/.keep
